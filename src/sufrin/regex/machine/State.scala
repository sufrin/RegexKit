/**
 * The state of an ongoing nondeterministic match for a regular expression pattern.
 * The pattern has been compiled into a program for a machine that runs
 * one or more deterministic recognisers concurrently. Each recogniser is
 * represented as a `Fibre` (a lightweight thread) with its own `pc` and its
 * own collection of ''groups'': pointers spanning parts of the text
 * recognised by individual parenthesised components of the regular expression.
 *
 * At each (major) cycle of the machine ''all'' running fibres consider the same
 * indexed value of the `input`, and decide whether or not ''their'' match
 * has succeeded, failed, must continue, or must fork into more than one
 * fibre.
 *
 * See below for further detail.

   *
   *   Each input is consumed by a major step in the algorithm, whose task is to compute

   *
   *   At the start of a major step, the `current` `FibreSet` represents the state of the NDFA
   *   as a set of currently-active fibres. The `pending` `FibreSet` will be empty.
   *
   *   During a major step, the current instruction of each active fibre is executed. This may
   *   give rise to the scheduling of additional fibres and/or the scheduling of
   *   the active fibre at its successor instruction.
   *
   *   The scheduling of a fibre is implemented by adding that fibre to the `pending` set,
   *   unless a fibre at the same instruction is already present there.
   *
   *   A major step is complete when all the fibres of `current` have executed their
   *   current instruction, or when a match result has been signalled by execution of
   *   a `Matched` instruction.

   *  '''Important Note:''' I gratefully acknowledge my colleague Mike Spivey's observation (based on
   *  the 1965 Thompson paper) that an appropriate technique for /searching/ rather than
   *  /matching/ is to spawn another thread at the origin of the program whenever the machine
   *  is about to shift to consideration of the next character.
   *  Although implemented here, the technique does not in general capture the content of
   *  nested groups appropriately during a search. In fact it can only ever be relied upon
   *  to find the end position of a match. One concrete example illustrating non-capture
   *  is an expression of the form `(R1)+R2` when `R2` is empty, or has a prefix
   *  that may match a prefix of `R1`.
   *
   *  My judgment is that in applications such as text editors it is not worth trying to compose the above
   *  technique to find the endpoint of a match with a quadratic "match backwards" (from the endpoint)
   *  to capture groups accurately.
   *
   *  TODO: implement `findEndOfPrefix`, and `findStartOfSuffix` using the groupless search technique, and
   *   then use these (composed with groupful `findSuffix`/`findPrefix`)  in faster `seekPrefix` and `seekSuffix`
   *   methods (that might be more useful in some settings).
