   *   Each `Fibre` represents a trace of an DFA recogniser -- for the expression from which
   *   `program` was compiled -- that has consumed the sequence of inputs between
   *   `startPos` and `sourcePos`
   *
   *   Each input is consumed by a major step in the algorithm, whose task is to compute
   *   the next NDFA state.
   *
   *   At the start of a major step, the `current` `FibreSet` represents the state of the NDFA
   *   as a set of currently-active fibres. The `pending` `FibreSet` will be empty.
   *
   *   During a major step, the current instruction of each active fibre is executed. This may
   *   give rise to the scheduling of additional fibres and/or the scheduling of
   *   the active fibre at its successor instruction.
   *
   *   The scheduling of a fibre is implemented by adding that fibre to the `pending` set,
   *   unless a fibre at the same instruction is already present there.
   *
   *   A major step is complete when all the fibres of `current` have executed their
   *   current instruction, or when a match result has been signalled by execution of
   *   a `Matched` instruction.

   *  '''Important Note:''' I gratefully acknowledge my colleague Mike Spivey's observation (based on
   *  the 1965 Thompson paper) that an appropriate technique for /searching/ rather than
   *  /matching/ is to spawn another thread at the origin of the program whenever the machine
   *  is about to shift to consideration of the next character.
   *  Although implemented here, the technique cannot be guaranteed to capture the content of
   *  nested groups appropriately during a search; indeed it can only ever be relied upon
   *  to find the end position of a match. One case in point is an expression of the form
   *  `(R1)+R2` when `R2` is empty, or has a prefix that may match a prefix of `R1`.
   *
   *  My judgment is that under most circumstances it is not worth trying to compose the above
   *  technique to find the endpoint of a match with a quadratic "match backwards" (from the endpoint)
   *  to capture groups accurately.
